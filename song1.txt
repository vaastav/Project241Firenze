I've been out walking, for hours
I got something on my mind
How did we get here? Where are we going?
Why is life so hard

I read the stories, see the photographs
World's a crazy space
Got to hold on to my dreams
There's just no other place
There's just no other place

I believe
We can change anything
I believe
We can rise above it
I believe
There's a reason for everything
I believe
In my dream

I've seen the shadows, of the living
I've seen them turn and walk away
And I keep searching, for the right words
To send these thoughts away

There's a picture, I like to look at
A picture of a beautiful face
And I see something, in her eyes
Sends me to a better place
Sends me to a better place

I believe
We can change anything
I believe
We can rise above it
I believe
There's a reason for everything
I believe
In my dream
I believe
We can change anything
I believe
In my dream
